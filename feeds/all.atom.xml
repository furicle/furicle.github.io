&lt;p&gt;Being of a certain age - i.e. older than average - and yes, I looked it up just now to see what the average age in this country is...
I've been exposed to music and other poetry that isn't as commonly floating around any more,  and I think that's a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, there's lots of good new stuff out there, but you can pick that up elsewhere.  I'm just pulling random nuggets I think are less common from the past here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's selection - from a band that never really went for much but toe tapping pop before or since - a set of lyrics that actually read in very stark contrast to the melody that made them famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking On A Thin Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Huey Lewis &amp;amp; The News&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for the light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taught me how to shoot to kill
A specialist with a deadly skill
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's over now or so they say
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way
'Cause you're never the same
When you've been under fire, no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had one or two before, but never had enough output to bother keeping them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the typical pattern of enthusiasim, a bunch of posting, then slowly the posts drift further and further apart until it's been a year... and you drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back I made a Jykell(?) site and hooked it up to git hub pages,  without really planning on using it, more so I could justify that yearly domain renewal bill :-)
It kinda worked, but I never liked the process, or the software.  I'm sure it's a me thing, not a Jykell thing, but it didn't gel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've swapped from Twitter to Mastodon completely, and that was good enough for the little snippets I liked throwing out from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other day I had a snark inspiration that was too long for a single masto post, and I didn't want to break it up.  I didn't find a good way to make it appear the way I wanted - without having a blog again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we go again I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was &lt;a href="https://github.com/gyptazy/manpageblog"&gt;manpageblog&lt;/a&gt;.  It looked very simple and straight forward, just what I was after.
But after poking a bit, I found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broken links on the README page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a demo site that was down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instructions that were incomplete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine I could get it to work, but the vibes weren't great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So throwing another dart at the board, let's try (Pelican)[https://getpelican.com].
AGPL, lots of activity on the repository, output looks pretty simple, made with a programming language I have scripted in, and extensive docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a quickstart, that actually recommends reading the full docs,  and full docs that tell you to start with the quick start :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I read thru the quickstart, then moved to the skipping around in the full docs before I did anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The docs seem to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; so far, with things spelled out clearly, but there's some odd choices like the back and forth above around the quickstart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for instance the &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/install.html#"&gt;Installing&lt;/a&gt; section - there's five paragraphs of how to install, followed by
"While the above is the simplest method, the recommended approach is to create a virtual environment for Pelican via virtualenv before installing Pelican."
To their credit, they go on to explain how to do that, but why wait for six paragraphs to mention the 'recommended' way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I hit "Typographical enhancements can be enabled in your settings file, but first the requisite Typogrify library must be installed:"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno, maybe I'm not the typical user, but what the heck exactly are the "typographical enhancements?"    Five cylinder words without any explanation is never a good thing, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less I've persevered (read, spent five to ten minutes a couple times when I had a minute to poke at it) and got something working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I'll publish more info on the how and what, since I was hardly organized about  it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that's something you do want to see, hit me up on Mastodon to write it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for content going forward, I'm planning on having no plan.   Right now I've got some rough thoughts that fall into either techy sysadmin stuff,  or musings from a middle aged parent and partner, or snark.&lt;br&gt;
If I dump the snark here, maybe I'll expose the people around me to it a little less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide this blog over rss, and try to tag things fairly well.  That way you can either subscribe to tech, snark, or the whole random static experience etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as I flesh it out.  Or don't, and have a nice day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="publishing"></category><category term="python"></category></entry></feed>
