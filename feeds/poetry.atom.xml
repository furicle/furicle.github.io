&lt;h3&gt;Aerosmith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those cases where the pop-rock 3:05 song format&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; doesn't translate that well to the page.
And honestly, it feels a bit padded out for length even as a song.

And honestly, it feels a bit padded out for length even as a song.
I resisted the urge to trim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of all that, the same people that mastered the art of nudge nudge wink wink,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
snuck a bit of social commentary into this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't his
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister you're a better man than I, oh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(Everybody, everybody)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation
Is getting to you, yeah
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation
Is getting to you
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again, and again, and again, and again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go
But I would rather be a hanging on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(Everybody, everybody)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get talkin' to me
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Living on the edge
You can't stop yourself from falling
Living on the edge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These wounds won't seem to heal&lt;br&gt;
This pain is just too real&lt;br&gt;
There's just too much that time cannot erase  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears&lt;br&gt;
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears&lt;br&gt;
And I held your hand through all of these years&lt;br&gt;
But you still have all of me  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You used to captivate me by your resonating light&lt;br&gt;
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind&lt;br&gt;
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams&lt;br&gt;
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being of a certain age - i.e. older than average - and yes, I looked it up just now to see what the average age in this country is...
I've been exposed to music and other poetry that isn't as commonly floating around any more,  and I think that's a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, there's lots of good new stuff out there, but you can pick that up elsewhere.  I'm just pulling random nuggets I think are less common from the past here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's selection - from a band that never really went for much but toe tapping pop before or since - a set of lyrics that actually read in very stark contrast to the melody that made them famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking On A Thin Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Huey Lewis &amp;amp; The News&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for the light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taught me how to shoot to kill
A specialist with a deadly skill
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's over now or so they say
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way
'Cause you're never the same
When you've been under fire, no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's done to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me, I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for? No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line&lt;/p&gt;
