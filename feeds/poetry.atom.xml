&lt;h3&gt;Aerosmith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those cases where the pop-rock 3:05 song format&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; doesn't translate that well to the page.
And honestly, it feels a bit padded out for length even as a song.

&lt;p&gt;In spite of all that, the same people that mastered the art of nudge nudge wink wink,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; snuck a bit of social commentary into this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something wrong with the world today&lt;br&gt;
I don't know what it is&lt;br&gt;
Something's wrong with our eyes&lt;br&gt;
We're seeing things in a different way&lt;br&gt;
And God knows it ain't his&lt;br&gt;
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
Living on the edge  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something wrong with the world today&lt;br&gt;
The light bulb's getting dim&lt;br&gt;
There's meltdown in the sky&lt;br&gt;
If you can judge a wise man&lt;br&gt;
By the color of his skin&lt;br&gt;
Then mister you're a better man than I, oh  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
(You can't help yourself from falling)&lt;br&gt;
Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
(You can't help yourself at all)&lt;br&gt;
Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
(You can't stop yourself from falling)&lt;br&gt;
Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
(Everybody, everybody)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me what you think about your situation&lt;br&gt;
Complication, aggravation&lt;br&gt;
Is getting to you, yeah&lt;br&gt;
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling&lt;br&gt;
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling&lt;br&gt;
Back again?&lt;br&gt;
I bet you would my friend&lt;br&gt;
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, tell me what you think about your situation&lt;br&gt;
Complication, aggravation&lt;br&gt;
Is getting to you&lt;br&gt;
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling&lt;br&gt;
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling&lt;br&gt;

Again, and again, and again, and again  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something right with the world today&lt;br&gt;
And everybody knows it's wrong&lt;br&gt;
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go&lt;br&gt;
But I would rather be a hanging on  &lt;/p&gt;

Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
Living on the edge&lt;br&gt;
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get talkin' to me&lt;br&gt;

This pain is just too real&lt;br&gt;
There's just too much that time cannot erase  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears&lt;br&gt;
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears&lt;br&gt;
And I held your hand through all of these years&lt;br&gt;
But you still have all of me  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You used to captivate me by your resonating light&lt;br&gt;
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being of a certain age - i.e. older than average - and yes, I looked it up just now to see what the average age in this country is...
I've been exposed to music and other poetry that isn't as commonly floating around any more,  and I think that's a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, there's lots of good new stuff out there, but you can pick that up elsewhere.  I'm just pulling random nuggets I think are less common from the past here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Walking On A Thin Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Huey Lewis &amp;amp; The News&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in my bed at night&lt;br&gt;
I curse the dark and I pray for the light&lt;br&gt;
And sometimes, the light's no consolation  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinded by a memory&lt;br&gt;
Afraid of what it might do to me&lt;br&gt;
And the tears and the sweat&lt;br&gt;
Only mock my desperation  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door&lt;br&gt;
The one you find so easy to ignore&lt;br&gt;
Is that what I was fightin' for  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line&lt;br&gt;
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks&lt;br&gt;
Loose on the streets of the city  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line&lt;br&gt;
Angry all the time&lt;br&gt;
Take a look at my face&lt;br&gt;
See what it's doing to me  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taught me how to shoot to kill&lt;br&gt;
A specialist with a deadly skill&lt;br&gt;
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's over now or so they say&lt;br&gt;
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way&lt;br&gt;
'Cause you're never the same&lt;br&gt;
When you've been under fire, no  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door&lt;br&gt;
