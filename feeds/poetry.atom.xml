I wish that you would just leave&lt;br&gt;
'Cause your presence still lingers here&lt;br&gt;
And it won't leave me alone  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These wounds won't seem to heal&lt;br&gt;
This pain is just too real&lt;br&gt;
There's just too much that time cannot erase  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears&lt;br&gt;
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears&lt;br&gt;
And I held your hand through all of these years&lt;br&gt;
But you still have all of me  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You used to captivate me by your resonating light&lt;br&gt;
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind&lt;br&gt;
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams&lt;br&gt;
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These wounds won't seem to heal&lt;br&gt;
This pain is just too real&lt;br&gt;
There's just too much that time cannot erase  &lt;/p&gt;

But you still have all of me  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone&lt;br&gt;
But though you're still with me&lt;br&gt;
I've been alone all along  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears&lt;br&gt;
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears&lt;br&gt;
I held your hand through all of these years&lt;br&gt;
But you still have all of me  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, me  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being of a certain age - i.e. older than average - and yes, I looked it up just now to see what the average age in this country is...
I've been exposed to music and other poetry that isn't as commonly floating around any more,  and I think that's a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, there's lots of good new stuff out there, but you can pick that up elsewhere.  I'm just pulling random nuggets I think are less common from the past here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's selection - from a band that never really went for much but toe tapping pop before or since - a set of lyrics that actually read in very stark contrast to the melody that made them famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking On A Thin Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Huey Lewis &amp;amp; The News&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for the light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taught me how to shoot to kill
A specialist with a deadly skill
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's over now or so they say
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way
'Cause you're never the same
When you've been under fire, no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's done to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't you know me, I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for? No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line&lt;/p&gt;
