</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>From time to time, a chunk of music will snag my ear, and pull hard enough to shake loose a few thoughts, or feelings.</p>
<p>Being of a certain age - i.e. older than average - and yes, I looked it up just now to see what the average age in this country is...
I've been exposed to music and other poetry that isn't as commonly floating around any more,  and I think that's a shame.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there's lots of good new stuff out there, but you can pick that up elsewhere.  I'm just pulling random nuggets I think are less common from the past here.</p>
<p>Today's selection - from a band that never really went for much but toe tapping pop before or since - a set of lyrics that actually read in very stark contrast to the melody that made them famous.</p>
<h2>Walking On A Thin Line</h2>
<h3>Huey Lewis &amp; The News</h3>
<p>Sometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for the light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation</p>
<p>Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation</p>
<p>Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for</p>
<p>Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city</p>
<p>Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me</p>
<p>Taught me how to shoot to kill
A specialist with a deadly skill
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor</p>
<p>It's over now or so they say
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way
'Cause you're never the same
When you've been under fire, no</p>
<p>Don't you know me? I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for</p>
<p>Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city</p>
<p>Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's done to me</p>
<p>Don't you know me, I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fightin' for? No</p>
<p>Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line, labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city</p>
<p>Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me</p>
<p>Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line</p>
