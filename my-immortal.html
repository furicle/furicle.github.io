<h2>My Immortal</h2>
<h3>Evanescence</h3>
<p>I'm so tired of being here<br>
Suppressed by all my childish fears<br>
And if you have to leave<br>
I wish that you would just leave<br>
'Cause your presence still lingers here<br>
And it won't leave me alone  </p>
<p>These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
This pain is just too real<br>
There's just too much that time cannot erase  </p>
<p>When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
But you still have all of me  </p>
<p>You used to captivate me by your resonating light<br>
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind<br>
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams<br>
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  </p>
<p>These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
This pain is just too real<br>
There's just too much that time cannot erase  </p>
<p>When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
But you still have all of me  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone<br>
But though you're still with me<br>
I've been alone all along  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
I held your hand through all of these years<br>
But you still have all of me  </p>
<p>Me, me  </p>
