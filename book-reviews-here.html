</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>I completed my first book review in a while, and posted it over on <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/18722/book/284003466">Library Thing</a></p>
<p>Making a short review shorter,  I liked it, but I didn't love it, but I'm glad I read it.</p>
<p>The question is, should I be posting these reviews here?</p>
<p>All the reasons I'm running my own blog still apply - here, it's mine.  Somewhere else, I'm creating content for other people's benefit.</p>
<p>The other side of the ledger, it's a book review...  it kinda belongs on a book site, where book lovers, looking for information, are going to find it, and like it or hate it.  Here, nobody will find it, especially when they are trying to make a decision on investing time and money on their latest read.</p>
<p>Library Thing isn't Amazon.  On the other hand, Goodreads wasn't either, when I wrote reviews there.  Do I sound bitter?   Ah well, that ship has sailed.  I don't see Library Thing becoming an acquisition, at least any time soon.</p>
<p>I think I'll hedge my bets.  Library Thing does have an export function, but not for reviews.  You can however, easily see <a href="https://www.librarything.com/reviews/furicle">all your reviews on a single page</a>.  Amusingly, that just completed review was number 200!</p>
<p>I did a quick copy-paste into Libre Office Writer, and saved them as a single odt file.  That got me the data I care about backed up and on my system.  Then by running <code>pandoc -f odt -t markdown -o book-reviews.md 'book reviews.odt'</code> I've got a good start on what I need to repeat that here.  I'll take some time and split each of those review into it's own markdown file, then use the markdown to create posts here too.  Let's see how that goes for a while.</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>
