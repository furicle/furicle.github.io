<h3>Aerosmith</h3>
<p>This is one of those cases where the pop-rock 3:05 song format<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> doesn't translate that well to the page.
And honestly, it feels a bit padded out for length even as a song.
I resisted the urge to trim.</p>
<p>In spite of all that, the same people that mastered the art of nudge nudge wink wink,<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> 
snuck a bit of social commentary into this album.</p>
<p>There's something wrong with the world today<br>
I don't know what it is<br>
Something's wrong with our eyes<br>
We're seeing things in a different way<br>
And God knows it ain't his<br>
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah  </p>
<p>Living on the edge<br>
Living on the edge<br>
Living on the edge<br>
Living on the edge  </p>
<p>There's something wrong with the world today<br>
The light bulb's getting dim<br>
There's meltdown in the sky<br>
If you can judge a wise man<br>
By the color of his skin<br>
Then mister you're a better man than I, oh  </p>
<p>Living on the edge<br>
(You can't help yourself from falling)<br>
Living on the edge<br>
(You can't help yourself at all)<br>
Living on the edge<br>
(You can't stop yourself from falling)<br>
Living on the edge<br>
(Everybody, everybody)  </p>
<p>Tell me what you think about your situation<br>
Complication, aggravation<br>
Is getting to you, yeah<br>
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling<br>
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling<br>
Back again?<br>
I bet you would my friend<br>
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again  </p>
<p>Yeah, tell me what you think about your situation<br>
Complication, aggravation<br>
Is getting to you<br>
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling<br>
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling<br>
Back again?<br>
I bet you would my friend<br>
Again, and again, and again, and again  </p>
<p>Something right with the world today<br>
And everybody knows it's wrong<br>
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go<br>
But I would rather be a hanging on  </p>
<p>Living on the edge<br>
(You can't help yourself from falling)<br>
Living on the edge<br>
(You can't help yourself at all)<br>
Living on the edge<br>
(You can't stop yourself from falling)<br>
Living on the edge<br>
(Everybody, everybody)  </p>
<p>Living on the edge<br>
Living on the edge<br>
Living on the edge<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...  </p>
<p>Get talkin' to me<br>
Living on the edge<br>
You can't help yourself from falling<br>
Living on the edge<br>
You can't help yourself at all<br>
Living on the edge<br>
You can't stop yourself from falling<br>
Living on the edge  </p>
<p>Living on the edge<br>
You can't help yourself<br>
You can't help yourself<br>
Living on the edge<br>
You can't help yourself at all  </p>
<p>Living on the edge<br>
You can't help yourself<br>
You can't help yourself<br>
Living on the edge<br>
You can't help yourself<br>
You can't help yourself<br>
Living on the edge<br>
You can't help yourself at all  </p>
<p>Living on the edge<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah...  </p>

<p>I'm so tired of being here<br>
Suppressed by all my childish fears<br>
And if you have to leave<br>
I wish that you would just leave<br>
'Cause your presence still lingers here<br>
And it won't …</p>
