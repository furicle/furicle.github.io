<h3>Aerosmith</h3>
<p>This is one of those cases where the pop-rock 3:05 song format<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> doesn't translate that well to the page.
And honestly, it feels a bit padded out for length even as a song.
I resisted the urge to trim.</p>
<p>In spite of all that, the same people that mastered the art of nudge nudge wink wink,<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> 
snuck a bit of social commentary into this album.</p>
<p>There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't his
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah</p>
<p>Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge</p>
<p>There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister you're a better man than I, oh</p>
<p>Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(Everybody, everybody)</p>
<p>Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation
Is getting to you, yeah
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again</p>
<p>Yeah, tell me what you think about your situation
Complication, aggravation
Is getting to you
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again, and again, and again, and again</p>
<p>Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go
But I would rather be a hanging on</p>
<p>Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(Everybody, everybody)</p>
<p>Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...</p>
<p>Get talkin' to me
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Living on the edge
You can't stop yourself from falling
Living on the edge</p>
<p>Living on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all</p>
<p>Living on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself
You can't help yourself
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all</p>
<p>Living on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah...</p>
